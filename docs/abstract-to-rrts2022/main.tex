\maketitle
In last decade, it has been a good response from the scientific community to adapt the full scientific replication, including code, data and software \cite{peng2011}. 
%published a roadmap for open and reproducible science going from publication only to 
However, there is a current need to adapt the best practices of fully scientific replication workflows to the combination of software and hardware.
Diederich \textit{et al.} 2022, for instance, highlighted the challenges of proper file-sharing and policies for hardware, which lead Diederich \textit{et al.} to propose the use of guidelines like Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) and workshops for Open Hardware Makers as way to create more trustworthy science \cite{Diederich2022}.
Similarly, Stirling \textit{et al.} 2022 proposed hardOps, hardware operations, as way to address challenges in reproducibility for hardware, consisting on six stages: plan, design and document, prepare and verify, distributed production, physical testing, and feedback \cite{stirling2022}. 
Hence, following up previous our work on "open-corTeX: A framework for Continuously-integrated Open-source Reproducible TeX" \cite{xochicale2020}, this work presents a workshop on the best practices for Software and Hardware operations, aiming to equipping the next generation of Biomedical Engineers with approrpiate skills and tools to create reproducible and trusthword science.
The workshops contains six lessons on (1) introduction to git, github, (2) project management, (3) continues integration, (4) standards, (5) exercises and (6) examples of projects following good practices for software and hardware.
The resources of the workshop are available at https://github.com/mxochicale/SofHarDevOps4BiomedicalEng.
