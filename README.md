# :hammer_and_wrench: :octocat:	Hands-on Workshop for Biomedical Engineers on Software/Hardware Development toolkits using Git and Github

## Aims  
The aim of this workshop is to provide an introduction to the GitHub toolkits to manage the development of software and hardware projects.  

## Audience
This workshop is targeted to persons with little to none experience with GitHub tools. However, intermediate and advance users might also find the topics of interests.

## Dates
Late July/ Early August 

## Author(s)
Miguel Xochicale, Ph.D., ...

## Prerequisites  
* Create GitHub account: https://github.com/  
* Ready to use terminal applications: [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org) for windows users and a terminal for mac and Linux users.  
* Setting up Setting up [SSH keys](tools/ssh)

## Content
1. Introduction to GitHub 
	* Version control 
	* Git
		* The Good 
		* The Bad 
	* The concepts  
		* Commits 
		* Graphs 
		* Branches / Tags 
		* Detaching 
		* Conflicts 
		* Rebasing 
		* Merging 
		* Cherry picking 

2. Project management  
	* Project  
	* Milestones 
	* Labels 
	* Discussions 
	* Wikis  
	* repository forks and what they are for (ie. allowing outside users to propose PRs without being collaborators on the original repo), 

3. Continous Integration
	* Actions 
	* doing code releases through Github and 
	* triggering actions to do deployment (eg. uploading to PyPI for Python), 
	* other continuous integration tasks such as testing before PRs can be accepted 


3. Exercises 
	* doing PRs in Github and what the protocol for that should be for a small team, 
	* PRs between forks, 

4. Software/Hardware projects
	* Version control for CAD files (pcbs, stls, others) 
	* Markdown  
	* CHANGELOGs 
	* Jupyter notebook features 
	* Jupyterlab - it helps prevent some of the more common errors as well as just being convenient if Jupyter is something you're standardising on. 
	* Projects combining software/hardware 
		* https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover  
		* https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot

Essentially it asks a series of questions and then tells you the combination of git commands to fix whatever you need. I find it useful when you have done something particularly stupid (say pushed to remote when you did not mean to). [by RS]
