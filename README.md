## Abstract 
In last decade, there has been a good response from the scientific community to adopt the full scientific replication, including code, data, and software (Peng 2011). 
However, there is a current need to adopt the best practices of fully scientific replication workflows to both software and hardware.
Recently, Diederich et al. 2022, for instance, highlighted the challenges of proper file-sharing and policies for hardware, which led Diederich et al. to suggest using guidelines of Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) and workshops for Open Hardware Makers as way to create more trustworthy science (Diederich2022).
Similarly, Stirling et al. 2022 proposed hardOps, hardware operations, as a way to address challenges in reproducibility for hardware, consisting on six stages: plan, design and document, prepare and verify, distributed production, physical testing, and feedback (Stirling 2022). 
Hence, following up our previous work on "open-corTeX: A framework for Continuously-integrated Open-source Reproducible TeX" (Xochicale 2020), this work presents a workshop on the best practices for Software and Hardware operations, aiming to equipping the next generation of Biomedical Engineers with appropriate skills and tools to create reproducible and trustworthy science.
The workshop contains six lessons on (1) introduction to git, GitHub, (2) project management, (3) continuous integration, (4) standards, (5) exercises and (6) examples of projects.

## Workshop
### Aims  
The aim of this workshop is to provide an introduction to the GitHub toolkits to manage the development of software and hardware projects for biomedical engineers.  

### Audience
This workshop is targeted to persons with little to no experience with GitHub tools. However, intermediate and advance users might also find the topics of interests.

### Dates and times
22 to 26 August 2022! (Exact days to be confirmed)

### Instructor(s)
Miguel, etc 


### Prerequisites  
* Create GitHub account: https://github.com/
